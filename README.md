### Introduction
VR FPS Engine was a stackathon project built by Bogdan and Damon in the time span of 4 days. It is a simple boilerplate for virtual reality and first person shooter games. Using simple WASD and space to jump a player can go around the map destroying cabbages (boxes) that are randomly generated on the map. At a certain point the cabbages randomly generate again. A player can click to shoots a bullet. When the bullet collides with the cabbage, it disappears. The cabbages and bullet are customizable. Double jump is a thing.
